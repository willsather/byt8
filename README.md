Introducing byt8: A modern, redesigned daily reflection app that simplifies the recording process and quickly can drive personal insights.  As simple as scrolling through a dating app, byt8 asks 8 easy questions yes/no every day in order to give more intuition in your personal life.  By spending 2 minutes each day reflecting on the good things and the bad things, you can start to make changes for the better. 

Derived from the theory of computer storage, byt8 asks 8 binary questions a day.  A byte, in nerd terms, is eight bits, either ones or zeroes, which store a true or false value.  However, even though a byte is only eight bits, it can store up to 255 different integer values.  If you think about this philosophically, such a small number of true or false questions can actually provide vastly different combinations of your day, mood, and overall feeling.

This is the core meaning and use of the app: byt8.  As you collect data daily, the app has built in statistical analysis of the days you record, allowing for retroactive analysis.  Secondly, just by recording your overall thoughts on your day, you are able to think productively about the highs and lows of the events and happenings of your day.  

As time progress, data becomes more valuable.  Given the new age of this app, the statistics page is still growing and will continue to grow to provide more functionality and learning, with the end goal of using artificial intelligence to give multi-variable trends and intuition.  However, just by starting to collect data now, you can allow for the app to grow and become more functional, while still providing the self analysis of your day.  

All of byt8â€™s data is safely and securely stored in the cloud so you can rest easy knowing your personal and gather data is protected.  

Download today and start using byt8 to finally start reflecting to drive your goals for personal betterment.
